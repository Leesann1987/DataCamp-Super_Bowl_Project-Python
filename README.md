# DataCamp-Super_Bowl_Project-Python

I am currently working through the Data Science with Python stream on DataCamp, which offer learners the opportunity to build a portfolio through guided projects.

This project explores the history of the Super Bowl, with the following questions being asked:
1. What are the most extreme game outcomes?
2. How does the game affect television viewership?
3. How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time? and
4. Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

Despite my lack of interest in any sport, this project gave me a neat perspective on how data is used within the sports industry. Showcased are my basic to intermediate level Python literacy skills, as well as a few of the most fundamental techniques used by data scientists, including data exploration, cleaning, visualization and interpretation. 

The narrative and tasks presented were created by DataCamp as a guide, and only the most basic of plots were created in the initial run through. After successfully completing each task, however, I went back to customize outputs and plots that you see in the Jupyter Notebook. Details regarding where the dataset were scraped from are included in the notebook.
